//        You will need two players. First player will be user controlled, second player will be the CPU.
//                The objective of this game is to make sure the CPU does not hit the ball, for which you
//                will gain a point.
//        Ask the player which side of the table they would like to swing their paddle (left or right).
//                Have a random generator of a ping pong ball that will determine what side of the table
//                the ball is going to.
//                If you swing the paddle at the same side the ball is going then it's the CPU's turn to
//                swing. If you miss, the CPU gets a point
//        Same dynamic applies for the CPU, except you will need to write a function that will determine
//                what side the CPU will be swinging at.
//        First player to 7 points wins!

        //userSwing = getUserSwing ; user swings first
        //cpuSwing = getCPCSwing
        //userScore
        //cpuScore

    }
